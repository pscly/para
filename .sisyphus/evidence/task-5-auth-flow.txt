Task 5 Evidence: Auth + device sessions

Verified via pytest + FastAPI TestClient:
- register -> 201 returns access_token + refresh_token
- duplicate register -> 409
- me (Authorization: Bearer <access_token>) -> 200 returns user_id + email
- login wrong password -> 401
- refresh rotates: new refresh works, old refresh becomes 401
- logout (Authorization: Bearer <access_token>) revokes refresh tokens; subsequent refresh -> 401

Commands used:
- (server) uv run pytest
- (root) ./scripts/generate-contracts.sh

Notes:
- refresh token is returned to client as raw string; server stores only sha256 hash in DB.
- access token is HS256-signed token implemented in stdlib (not full JWT library yet).
